    <h1>My Profile Page</h1>
    <h2>Introduction:</h2>
    <p>Hello! My name is <strong>Ngoc</strong>, you can call me <strong>Nancy</strong>. I am 24 years old and from Vietnam, a beautiful country in Asia. My family lives in Ho Chi Minh City, and I have an older brother who works as a mechanical engineer in Utah. In my free time, I like doing nails for my friends, watching horror movies, and cooking Vietnamese food to share with others. I am a sophomore at BYU Hawaii, and I really enjoy the diversity and culture here. I have made great friends and learned a lot about different cultures. Besides my classes, I love joining club activities. I am also the president of the Vietnam Club, where I share my culture and bring people together. </p>
    As a student and a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, I have learned many important lessons since my mission. Studying at BYU Hawaii and serving as a leader has taught me the value of hard work, service, and setting a good example. These experiences have helped me grow spiritually, emotionally, and intellectually. I am truly grateful for these opportunities to prepare for a bright future.

    <h2>More things about me:</h2>
    <p>I love attending devotionals every Tuesday at the CAC and listening to the wonderful messages from different leaders of the Church. One time, Elder John H. Groberg visited us and inspired us greatly with his real-life story, which is portrayed in the movie <em>"The Other Side of Heaven "</em> </p>
    <h2>One of my favorite quote:</h2>
    <blockquote>
        <em>"It is our service and ministering to others, especially to those whom the Savior refers to as &#39;the least of these,&#39; that moves us forward in our eternal progression."</em>
    </blockquote>
